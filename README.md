# Number-Guesser
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>In this project, I wrote a JavaScript function to power a small guessing game. This is a javascript project where the user must guess a number between 0-9 as well as the computer opponent. Each round determines which player hits the nearest
target number, the player that is nearest to the target number wins.</p>
